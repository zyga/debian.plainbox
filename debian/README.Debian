This package was altered in comparison to the original upstream
tarball. The plainbox.vendor python package was almost entirely
removed and replaced with direct usage of unittest.mock and inspect
modules from the python3.3 standard library.

The upstream project ships those extra files to work on python3.2
without additional dependencies but those copies are not necessary as
Debian already carries the required software in the python3.3
package.
